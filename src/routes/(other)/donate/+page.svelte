				The World Affairs Conference is a non-profit, student-initiated event dedicated
				to fostering meaningful dialogue about the most pressing issues shaping our
				global community. Led by students and supported by educators, the conference
				provides a platform for young people to engage with diverse perspectives,
				develop critical thinking skills, and amplify their voices in an ever-changing
				world.

				As a non-profit initiative, we rely on the generosity of our community to
				continue this important work. Your donation directly supports student
				leadership, speaker programming, accessibility, and the ongoing growth of the
				conference.

				Any contribution, large or small, helps us further education, encourage
				thoughtful global citizenship, and give voice to the next generation of
				leaders. We are deeply grateful for your support.

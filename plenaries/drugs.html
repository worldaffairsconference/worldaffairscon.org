						<h1>Drug Legalization in a Progressive World</h1>

						<p class="card-text">
							<p>This past summer, the federal government of Canada has passed a bill to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. This bill however, was not the first of its kind. Over the past 10 years, multiple governments throughout the world have taken action to make many previously illegal drugs either legalized, or legal under certain conditions. Major international examples that have implemented such measures include the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and South Africa. Even within Canada, safe injection sites, sites where hard drugs such as cocaine and heroine are legally ingested under professional supervision, are becoming more and more prevalent. As politicians and activists call for more progressive action, the legalization movement is becoming more and more controversial with each new piece of legislature that is implemented. Should Canada take further steps to legalize other presently illegal drugs? Should Canada take a step back and reconsider its decision to legalize marijuana entirely? Should other countries follow Canada’s lead?</p>

						Alan Young is Co-Founder and Director of Osgoode Hall's innocence project, a clinical program that that guides JD students through the process of investigating suspected cases of wrongful conviction and imprisonment. In addition to this, he maintains a small practice specializing in criminal law and procedure that is primarily devoted to challenging state authority to criminalize consensual activity. Throughout his years of practice, he has represented countless numbers of people suffering from AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis who were charged after using marijuana for medicinal purposes, and as a result of these cases, the Federal Government was compelled to create a regulatory program authorizing the use of medical marijuana.
